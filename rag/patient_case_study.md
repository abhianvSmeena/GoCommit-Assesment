# Patient Case Study — Example

## Case Summary
- Age: 62
- PMH: Stage 2 CKD, Hypertension
- Current meds: ACE inhibitor, low-dose prednisone for inflammatory condition
- Presentation: Patient reports dizziness and lightheadedness after starting a short course of steroids.

## Key Considerations
- Steroid-induced hypertension or hyperglycemia may worsen dizziness.
- Orthostatic hypotension from volume shifts or medications (ACEi) is possible.
- CKD patients may have altered pharmacokinetics require close monitoring.

## Suggested Actions (for clinician demo only)
1. Check orthostatic vitals (supine, sit, stand).
2. Review medication timing and recent dose changes.
3. Basic labs: BMP (electrolytes, creatinine), glucose.
4. If severe symptoms or signs of acute coronary/neurologic event — urgent referral.
