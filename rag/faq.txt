Q: What should I do if I feel dizzy after taking my medication?
A: Stop and sit/lie down to avoid falls. If dizziness is mild and improves, contact your prescriber. If severe or accompanied by fainting, chest pain, or difficulty breathing, go to the emergency department.

Q: My report says 'stage 2 CKD.' What does that mean?
A: CKD stages are based on eGFR. Stage 2 indicates mild decrease in kidney function (eGFR 60-89 mL/min/1.73m^2). Discuss implications with your nephrologist or primary care physician.
