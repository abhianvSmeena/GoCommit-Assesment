# Clinical Guidelines for Hypertension Management

## Purpose
This document provides concise clinical guidelines for primary care providers managing adult patients with hypertension.

## Definitions
- **Hypertension (HTN):** Systolic BP ≥ 140 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg on two separate readings.

## Initial Evaluation
1. Confirm elevated blood pressure on two separate occasions.
2. Assess for secondary causes (renal disease, endocrine disorders).
3. Baseline labs: CBC, CMP, TSH, fasting lipid profile, HbA1c, urinalysis.

## Medication Recommendations
- **Stage 1 HTN (140-159 / 90-99):**
  - First-line: Thiazide diuretics or ACE inhibitors (e.g., lisinopril) depending on comorbidities.
- **Stage 2 HTN (≥160 / ≥100):**
  - Combination therapy often recommended.
- **Special considerations:**
  - CKD: ACE inhibitor or ARB preferred.
  - Diabetes: ACE inhibitor/ARB favored for renal protection.

## Monitoring & Follow-up
- Reassess BP within 2–4 weeks after initiating or changing medication.
- Monitor renal function and potassium 1–2 weeks after starting ACEi/ARB.

## Emergency Signs (Red Flags)
- Sudden chest pain, severe shortness of breath, neurological deficits, or marked BP > 180/120 — refer to ED immediately.
